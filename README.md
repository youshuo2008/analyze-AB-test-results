### Project Title
Analyzing A/B test results

### Project Description
This project is part of my Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.

The goal of the project is to perform A/B testing and help an e-Commerce company understand whether they should implement a new web page layout. I used both hypothesis testing and logistic regression to compare the conversion rate (proportion of users who paid for the company's product) between the new web page layout and the old page layout. Both approaches revealed similar answers.


### Files used
The 'ab_data.csv' contains info of the A/B test results.
The 'countries.csv' records the country of origin for each user id.
Both csv files were provided by Udacity.

### Credits
Special thanks to my Udacity teachers: Richard Kalehoff, Juno Lee, Karl Krueger, Josh Bernhard, Sebastian Thrun, Mike Yi, Daivid Venturi, Mat Leonard, Sam Nelson, Derek Steer and mentors: Raj V and George L as well as Udacity's project reviewers.
