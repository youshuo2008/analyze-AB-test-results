### Project Title
Analyzing A/B testing results

### Project Description
This project is part of my Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. <br />
The goal of the project is to perform A/B testing and help an e-Commerce company understand whether they should implement a new web page layout. To answer this question, I compared conversion rates (proportion of users who paid for the company's product) between the new and old web page layout using both hypothesis testing and logistic regression. Both approaches revealed similar answer: There are no significant differences in conversion rates based on which page a customer receives (new page vs old page).


### Files used
The 'ab_data.csv' contains info of the A/B test results. <br />
The 'countries.csv' records the country of origin for each user id. <br />
Both csv files were provided by Udacity. <br />
