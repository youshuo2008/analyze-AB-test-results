### Project Title
Analyzing A/B test results

### Project Description
This project is part of my Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree.
An e-Commerce company developed a new web page to increase the number of users who pays for the company's product.
The goal of this project is to perform A/B testing and help the company understand whether they should implement the new web page or keep the old page.  

### Files used
The 'ab_data.csv' contains info of the A/B test results. 
The 'countries.csv' records the country of origin for each user id.
Both csv files were provided by Udacity.

### Credits
Special thanks to my Udacity teachers: Richard Kalehoff, Juno Lee, Karl Krueger, Josh Bernhard, Sebastian Thrun, Mike Yi, Daivid Venturi, Mat Leonard, Sam Nelson, Derek Steer and mentors: Raj V and George L as well as Udacity's project reviewers.
